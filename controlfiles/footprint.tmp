# AAHYWEH
# Control file for footprint calculation for Kljun et al  2015 approach (calc_footprint_FFP_climatology).
#
#  To convert this template to a version that works for data output by the standard OzFlux
#  data logger program:
#   1) Replace the following place holders with values for your site:
#      <site_name>              - the name of the site
#      <year>                   - the year of the data
#      <height>                 - the height of the measurement (above ground), m
#      <canopy_height>          - the average height of the canopy (above ground), m
#      <fp_size>                - length in m of a square around the tower
#      <fp_no_cells_per_length> - number of cells per length ==> footprint_size / num_cells = grid_resolution
#   2) Fill out the global and variable attributes
#

[Options]
    # ====================================================================================================
    # "Options" specifies the climatology of the footprints. Only one of the parameters, daily, 
    # monthly, annual, special or single can be set to Yes. Single and Special require Start and End-date,
    # otherwise the climatolgy for the whole data-set is calculated.
    # If 'Daily' is set to 'yes', a climatology is calculated for every single day of the data in the 
    # nc-file (Warning: if large files are processed the output nc-file is huge, one year of daily data 
    # for a grid of 250x250 produces about 200 MB of output).
    # If 'Monthly' is set the file is divided into monthly data and a climatology is calculated.
    # If 'Annual', then individual climatologies for each year in the data file are prodiced.
    # Length of time for the climatology
